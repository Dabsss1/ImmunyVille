    - n:Hi young boy! Have you moved recently to ImmunyVille? Your face is not familiar.
    - p:Yes! My family just moved here after they found out that I have a deadly
      disease.
    - n:I'm sorry to hear such terrible news. This must be incredibly difficult for
      you.
    - n:Perfect timing! Because of my age, I can no longer take care of the farm,
      and it would be a waste if I just let it go. I am currently looking for someone
      to take care of my farm. Are you interested?
    - p:Yes!
    - n:I'll give you 5 green bean seeds to help you get started. Just plant these
      seeds anywhere in the mountain plots.
    - n:I'll water those plants for you so you don't have to water them everyday.
      Just check the crops after a few days if they're ready to harvest.
    - n:Harvesting a plant will earn you gold which you can use to buy seeds and
      items in the supermarket.

    - s:*Dog Acquired*
    - p:Thank you for your help, Lola Helen!
