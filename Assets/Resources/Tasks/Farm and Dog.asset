    - n:Hi young boy! Have you moved recently to ImmunyVille? Your face is not familiar.
    - p:Yes! My family just moved here after they found out that I have a deadly
      disease.
    - n:I'm sorry to hear such terrible news. This must be incredibly difficult for
      you.
    - n:Perfect timing! Because of my age, I can no longer take care of the farm,
      and it would be a waste if I just let it go. I am currently looking for someone
      to take care of my farm. Are you interested?
    - p:Yes!
    - n:You can find and plant seeds scattered around the ImmunyVille. These seeds
      will grow and help you to strengthen your immune system!
    - s:*Farm Acquired*
    - n:My dog seems liking you. He will be going to follow you around ImmunyVille.
    - s:*Dog Acquired*
    - p:Thank you for your help, Lola Helen!
