  tips:
  - Choose good carbs, not no carbs. Whole grains are your best bet.
  - Pay attention to the protein package. Fish, poultry, nuts, and beans are the
    best choices.
  - Choose foods with healthy fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid
    foods with trans fat. Plant oils, nuts, and fish are the healthiest sources.
  - Choose a fiber-filled diet, rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.
  - "Eat more vegetables and fruits. Go for color and variety\u2014dark green, yellow,
    orange, and red."
  - "Calcium is important. But milk isn\u2019t the only, or even best, source."
  - 'Water is best to quench your thirst. Skip the sugary drinks, and go easy on
    the milk and juice.  '
  - "Eating less salt is good for everyone\u2019s health. Choose more fresh foods
    and fewer processed foods."
  - " Moderate drinking can be healthy\u2014but not for everyone. You must weigh
    the benefits and risks."
  - A daily multivitamin is a great nutrition insurance policy. Some extra vitamin
    D may add an extra health boost.
